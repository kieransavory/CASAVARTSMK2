                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>Recognised as Casavarts, or Chloe Savory, I am a self taught artist from the UK, 
                    exploring the realms within various paint, pencil and ink mediums.
                    Particularly notorious for a blend of pop culture, streetwear, 
                    consumerism and politics, my style is ever adapting into a fun, bold yet also dark
                    expression of my current interests and personal depictions of the world around me.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>My style truly began to take shape within my sixth-form years, 
                    when I started to properly establish not only my artistic abilities, but also my
                    perspective of the reality in which we live. A lot of my work developed into a reflection of my feelings towards consumerism,
                    materialism, war, objectification, climate change and drug use.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>I am currently operating as a resident tattoo artist at Black Magic Ink tattoo 
                    studio, located in Cheltenham.
