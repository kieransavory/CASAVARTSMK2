                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>Recognised as Casavarts, or Chloe Savory, I am a self taught artist from the UK, 
                    exploring the realms within various paint, pencil and ink mediums.
                    Particularly notorious for a blend of pop culture, streetwear, 
                    consumerism and politics, my style is ever adapting into a fun, bold yet also dark
                    expression of my current interests and personal depictions of the world around me.
                </p>
                <p>My style truly began to take shape within my sixth-form years, 
                    when I started to properly establish not only my artistic abilities, but also my
                    perspective of the reality in which we live. A lot of my work developed into a reflection of my feelings towards consumerism,
                    materialism, war, objectification, climate change and drug use.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently operating as a resident tattoo artist at Magnum Circus Tattoo
                    studio, located in Cheltenham.

                    <summary>How do I look after my tattoo?</summary>
                    <span>After your tattoo, I will provide you with an aftercare sheet detailing the best way to care for your tattoo. I usually recommend an
                        organic coconut oil during the healing process in order to keep the affected skin moisturised and ensure the best quality of tattoo after
                        the healing process.

                    <span>The best way to book a tattoo is through my Instagram. See my contact information below if you would like to book a tattoo!</span>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Do you require a deposit?</summary>
                    <span>Depending on the size of the tattoo, I may ask for a deposit beforehand. I may also ask for a deposit before commencing any design work,
                        dependent on size and complexity of the tattoo.
                    </span>

                <details>
                    <summary>How long do I leave the "sanicare" bandage on for?</summary>
                   <span>I recommend to clients that they leave the sanicare bandage on for at least 48 hours after their appointment.</span> 
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Can I get a tattoo if I have consumed alcohol or taken blood thinning medication?</summary>
                    <span>Unfortunately, I cannot proceed with a tattoo if you have drank alcohol within the last 8 hours
                        or taken blood thinning medication at least 24 hours prior to your tattoo, as this is more likely to induce heavy bleeding, which 
                        may push the ink out of the tattooed area and affect the quality of the healed tattoo.</span> 
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Can I swim after a tattoo?</summary>
                    <span>Avoid swimming or submerging your tattoo in water for at least 3 weeks after your appointment. As the tattooed area is effectively 
                        an open wound, it is imperative that it is not submerged in water to minimise the risk of infection. You can however shower, as long as the 
                        affected area is not submerged for prolonged periods of time and is dried gently with a clean towel.
                    </span>
